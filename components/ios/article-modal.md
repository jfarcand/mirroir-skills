# Article Modal

## Description

Full-screen modal presenting an informational article with a title bar and X dismiss
button. Common in Health/Santé (medication articles, health tips), App Store (app
descriptions), and other apps that present read-only content as a modal overlay.
The YOLO icon detector reports the X button as "icon" rather than text.

## Visual Pattern

- Title text centered or left-aligned in a header bar
- Dismiss icon (X) on the right side of the header, detected as "icon" by YOLO
- Large content area below with article text (paragraphs, images)
- No back chevron (modal, not push navigation)
- No tab bar visible (modal covers the underlying screen)
