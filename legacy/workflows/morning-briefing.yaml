app: Weather, Calendar, Messages
description: >
  Check the weather, read today's schedule, and send a morning
  summary via iMessage. The AI reads live data from two apps and
  composes a natural-language briefing — something only an AI
  executor can do. No APIs, no integrations, just screen reading.
